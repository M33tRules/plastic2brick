        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 20px;">The Eco-Brick Initiative is a forward-thinking sustainability project aimed at addressing the global plastic waste crisis by transforming plastic into a valuable resource. By incorporating recycled plastics into bricks, we not only reduce plastic waste but also enhance the durability and strength of traditional construction materials.<br><br> This innovative approach tackles two key environmental issues: waste management and sustainable construction. Our project seeks to promote a circular economy where plastic waste is repurposed to build stronger, more sustainable communities. <br><br>

        <p style="color: #000; font-size: 20px;">Our vision goes beyond recycling. We aim to educate and empower communities in Tanzania and globally by creating a model that showcases the potential of reusing plastics for construction. Through collaboration with local NGOs, we will foster a grassroots movement that encourages people to take action against plastic pollution. <br><br>The Eco-Brick Initiative strives to turn waste into opportunity, contributing to a cleaner, greener, and more resilient world.</p>

    <h1 style="padding-top: 150px;">About Us</h1>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px; font-size: 20px;">The Eco-Brick Initiative was founded by three high school students, Meet Patel, Shimmer Gupta, and Shaurya Kumar, who share a deep commitment to sustainability and innovation. With diverse backgrounds in technology, environmental science, and project management, each founder brings a unique perspective to the project. Our combined passion for tackling the world’s environmental challenges drives the Eco-Brick Initiative forward. As young changemakers, we envision a future where waste is no longer a burden but a resource that can power sustainable growth.</p>

By repurposing waste that would otherwise contribute to pollution, we are establishing a model for sustainable construction that can be replicated in various communities. Our eco-bricks are designed to meet building standards while providing an innovative solution to the pressing issue of plastic waste.</p>

            <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 20px;">Our project plans to hold Eco-Brick Workshops with the objective of educating the community about eco-bricks, demonstrating their creation process, and showcasing their potential uses in construction and art. <br><br>
                We envision these workshops being held at schools and community centres, where participants can bring their plastic waste and learn how to create eco-bricks. These bricks can then be used for practical purposes, such as building garden beds or small structures. To enhance the success of these workshops, we plan on partnering with NGO’s for structuring the sessions, providing technical expertise, and helping us reach a broader audience through its network. <br><br>
                In addition to the workshops, we propose organizing Community Plastic Clean-up Drives aimed at engaging local residents in reducing plastic waste within their neighbourhoods while collecting materials for the eco-brick initiative. <br><br>

        <div class="column"> 
            <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 20px;">We plan to host monthly clean-up drives across different communities in Dar-es-Salaam. During these events, participants will not only collect plastic waste but also receive valuable information on proper waste sorting and disposal practices. <br><br>
                Additionally, we aim to host a Plastic Recycling and Sustainability Exhibition that will showcase our eco-bricks alongside other recycled products, highlight innovative waste management solutions, and offer a platform for local environmental advocates. <br><br>
                This event, to be held in a central community space, will feature demonstrations, informational booths, and panel discussions about reducing plastic waste. We also intend to include local artisans who use recycled materials in their products. <br><br>
